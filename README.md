### Evening ðŸ‘‹

I like code that's correct, fast and readable. I'd say "in that order" but that would imply one can't have all three.

As you might have noticed, I am a fan of Rust. I also write games in it. Check out [RecWars](https://martin-t.gitlab.io/gitlab-pages/rec-wars/macroquad.html) and [RustCycles](https://github.com/rustcycles/rustcycles).
