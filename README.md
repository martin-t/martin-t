I like code that's correct, fast and readable. I'd say "in that order" but that would imply one can't have all three.

As you might have noticed, I like Rust. I also make games in it. For now only [RecWars](https://martin-t.gitlab.io/gitlab-pages/rec-wars/macroquad.html) is public but I am working on two other ideas.
